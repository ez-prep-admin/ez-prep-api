# Student session authentication (web + mobile)

This document describes how student (non-admin) login, access tokens, refresh, and logout work after the Redis session + HttpOnly web refresh hardening. Admin username/password auth is out of scope except where noted as unchanged.

Related: Redis key budget and session keys — [`REDIS.md`](./REDIS.md) § Student sessions. Legacy OTP overview (partially outdated on storage) — [`AUTHENTICATION.md`](./AUTHENTICATION.md).

## Goals and non-goals

### Goals

- Keep product behaviour the same: OTP, Google, dashboard, attempts, checkout, 7-day web “stay signed in”, logout, redirects.
- Shrink XSS blast radius: long-lived refresh secret must not be readable by JavaScript on the web.
- Keep web access JWTs short-lived (15 minutes) with silent refresh.
- Keep mobile JSON refresh contract intact until native SecureStore (Phase 12).
- Keep admin JWT path untouched (no Redis session, no refresh cookie).
- Stay within Upstash Redis free-tier command budget (event-driven only; no idle polling).

### Non-goals

- Next.js BFF / proxy for cookies.
- Putting the **access** JWT in an HttpOnly cookie (Bearer-in-memory keeps the existing axios pattern).
- Mobile SecureStore / shortened mobile access TTL (Phase 12).
- Full XSS audit of every frontend dependency.

## Actors and hosts (production)

| Piece | Host (EzPrep) | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student web (Next.js) | `https://ezprep.in` / `https://www.ezprep.in` | SPA; holds access JWT in **memory** only |
| API (NestJS) | `https://api.ezprep.in` | Issues JWTs, Redis sessions, `Set-Cookie` |
| Redis (Upstash) | managed | Revocable session + hashed refresh index |
| MongoDB | managed | User row; throttled `lastActiveAt` |

Production is **same-site, cross-origin** (`www` → `api` under `.ezprep.in`). CORS uses `credentials: true`. The refresh cookie uses `Domain=.ezprep.in` so credentialed calls from the SPA receive it.

Locally: SPA `http://localhost:3001`, API typically `http://localhost:3000`. Omit `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` so the cookie is host-only `localhost` (shared across ports).

---

## Token model

| Credential | Lifetime (web) | Lifetime (mobile) | Where it lives | Readable by JS? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access JWT | **15m** | ≈ session (90d idle window today) | Authorization Bearer; web = memory | Yes (accepted trade-off; short TTL) |
| Refresh (opaque) | **7d absolute** (no slide) | **90d sliding** on each refresh | Web: HttpOnly cookie `ezprep_rt`; mobile: JSON body | Web: **No**; mobile: app storage |
| Middleware marker `authSession=1` | **7d** (frontend only) | N/A | Cookie on the **web** origin | Yes — non-secret presence flag |
| Admin JWT | Long-lived (admin login) | N/A | Client-chosen | N/A — no Redis `sid` |

Constants: `src/auth/session/session.constants.ts`

- `WEB_SESSION_TTL_SEC` = 7d  
- `WEB_ACCESS_TTL_SEC` = 15m  
- `MOBILE_SESSION_TTL_SEC` / `MOBILE_ACCESS_TTL_SEC` = 90d (until Phase 12)

Access JWT claims (student): `sub`, `role`, optional `phoneNumber`, **`sid`** (Redis session id). Admin tokens have no `sid`.

## Architecture overview

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Browser
  participant Next as NextWww
  participant API as ApiEzprep
  participant Redis
  participant Mongo

  Browser->>API: login client=web (OTP or Google) credentials include
  API->>Mongo: resolve / create user
  API->>Redis: create session (sid + refresh hash)
  API-->>Browser: JSON accessToken 15m + Set-Cookie ezprep_rt HttpOnly
  Note over Browser: memory access only; authSession=1 on ezprep.in (7d)
  Browser->>API: API calls Bearer access + withCredentials
  Note over Browser,API: full page reload
  Browser->>API: POST /auth/refresh cookie only
  API->>Redis: rotate refresh; web keeps absolute 7d remainder
  API-->>Browser: new access 15m + rotated Set-Cookie
  Browser->>API: POST /auth/logout Bearer and/or cookie
  API->>Redis: revoke sid
  API-->>Browser: Clear-Cookie ezprep_rt
```

### Why not put access in HttpOnly?

- Existing clients and axios interceptors expect `Authorization: Bearer`.
- Dual extraction (cookie vs header) adds complexity for little gain while access TTL is 15m and logout revokes Redis.
- XSS can still use an in-memory access token until it expires; that is accepted with short TTL + revoke on logout.

### Why a frontend `authSession` marker?

Next.js Edge middleware runs on `ezprep.in` **before** any JS. It cannot see `ezprep_rt` (set by `api.ezprep.in`, path `/api/v1/auth`). The marker is a **non-secret** “maybe logged in” signal so hard navigations to `/dashboard` are not bounced to login before silent refresh runs.

**Marker Max-Age must be ~7d (session length), not 15m.** Aligning it to access TTL caused hard-reload logouts after idle: middleware redirected before JS could refresh. Access expiry is enforced by the API + silent refresh, not by Edge.

## Login flows

### Phone OTP (web)

1. MSG91 widget (`verify.msg91.com`) collects phone + OTP (and hCaptcha).
2. Widget returns an MSG91 access token to the SPA.
3. SPA: `POST /api/v1/auth/verify-otp` with `{ accessToken, client: 'web' }` and `credentials: 'include'`.
4. API verifies with MSG91, resolves/creates user, creates Redis session, returns:
   - JSON: `accessToken`, `expiresIn` (~900), `user`, `isNewUser` — **no `refreshToken` for web**
   - `Set-Cookie: ezprep_rt=…; HttpOnly; Secure (prod); SameSite=Lax; Path=/api/v1/auth; Domain=.ezprep.in (prod); Max-Age=<session remaining>`
5. SPA stores access in memory + writes `authSession=1` (7d).

### Google (web)

1. Authorization code + PKCE in the browser.
2. SPA: `POST /api/v1/auth/google` with code/verifier/`client: 'web'` and `credentials: 'include'`.
3. Same session issue path as OTP (HttpOnly refresh, omit JSON refresh).

### Google (mobile)

- `POST /api/v1/auth/google/mobile` with ID token.
- Defaults to `client=mobile`; returns `refreshToken` in JSON; **no** HttpOnly cookie.

### Client forcing (security)

`AuthService.resolveStudentClient`: if request `Origin` is listed in `CORS_ORIGINS`, the session is forced to **`web`** even if the body says `client: 'mobile'`. Native apps typically send no Origin, so they keep mobile semantics. This blocks browsers from opting into JSON refresh + long access JWT.

---

## Refresh

### Endpoint

`POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`

1. Refresh credential = **HttpOnly cookie first**, else JSON `{ refreshToken }` (mobile).
2. If cookie was used → `assertCookieRequestOrigin` (Origin/Referer ∈ `CORS_ORIGINS`; in production Origin or Referer required).
3. Redis: look up refresh hash → `sid`; if presented hash ≠ live session hash → **reuse / theft → revoke session** and fail.
4. Rotate refresh token; update hashes and TTLs:
   - **Web:** remaining absolute 7d (no slide).
   - **Mobile:** slide idle window +90d.
5. Issue new access JWT (`WEB_ACCESS_TTL_SEC` for web).
6. Web: new `Set-Cookie`; omit `refreshToken` from JSON. Mobile: include new `refreshToken` in JSON.
7. On failure: `Clear-Cookie` for web.

### Frontend silent refresh

- **Boot:** `AuthSessionProvider` calls `refreshAccessToken()` once per page load (module-level boot promise).
- **401:** axios interceptor retries after the same refresh helper.
- **Single-flight (critical):** all refresh calls share one in-flight promise in `ezprep-app/lib/auth.ts`. Parallel refresh (React Strict Mode remount + dashboard API 401 during boot) previously rotated twice; the second call looked like token reuse and **revoked the live session**, logging the user out on hard reload. Single-flight fixes that.
- Do not clear `authSession` while a refresh is in flight (marker is the only Edge signal until hydrate).

---

## Logout

`POST /api/v1/auth/logout` (optional JWT — so Clear-Cookie still runs when access already expired)

1. If refresh cookie present → Origin check.
2. Revoke Redis session by access `sid` when JWT present; else **`revokeByRefreshToken`** from the cookie (common after 15m access expiry).
3. Always `Clear-Cookie ezprep_rt`.
4. SPA: clear memory + `authSession` marker; navigate home.

---

## Request authentication (API)

1. `Authorization: Bearer <access JWT>`.
2. JWT signature + expiry.
3. If payload has `sid` (student Redis session): assert session still in Redis (positive in-process sid cache ~90s to save Upstash commands).
4. Throttled activity touch (~12 min): Redis `lastSeenAt` + optionally Mongo `lastActiveAt`.
5. Admin / legacy JWTs without `sid`: no Redis session check.

Degraded mode: `AUTH_SESSION_STORE=degraded` or Redis down → may issue legacy JWTs without `sid`; revocation is weak until Redis recovers. Log: `auth.session.degraded`.

## Cookie specification (`ezprep_rt`)

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `ezprep_rt` |
| HttpOnly | yes |
| Secure | yes when `NODE_ENV=production` |
| SameSite | `Lax` |
| Path | `/api/v1/auth` (only sent to auth routes) |
| Domain | `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` if set (prod: `.ezprep.in`); omit locally |
| Max-Age | Remaining Redis session TTL (seconds) |

Helpers: `src/auth/session/auth-cookie.ts`.

---

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated absolute origins (SPA + admin as needed). Required in production. Used for CORS **and** cookie Origin checks / web-client forcing. |
| `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` | Prod: `.ezprep.in`. Local: unset. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Access JWT signing. |
| `AUTH_SESSION_STORE` | Set `degraded` to skip Redis session enforcement. |
| `REDIS_URL` | Upstash `rediss://…` for sessions. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | SPA → API base (must match cookie host). |

Frontend CSP (Next.js `headers`) must allow MSG91, hCaptcha, hostnsoft, cdnjs, Google, Razorpay, and the API origin — otherwise OTP/widget breaks under enforcing CSP.

---

## Threat model (what this closes vs leaves)

| Measure | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| HttpOnly refresh | XSS cannot read the long-lived secret |
| 15m web access in memory | Stolen access dies quickly |
| No refresh in `localStorage` | Removes the previous main theft vector |
| Origin allowlist on cookie refresh/logout | CSRF hardening for credentialed cookie use |
| SameSite=Lax | Cross-site POST does not send the cookie |
| Refresh rotation + reuse revoke | Stolen refresh used after rotation kills the session |
| Force web when Origin ∈ CORS | Browser cannot request mobile JSON refresh |
| Next.js CSP | Shrinks XSS script/connect surface (OTP deps explicitly allowlisted) |

Still possible: XSS can call APIs with the **in-memory** access JWT until it expires. Mitigated by short TTL + Redis revoke on logout.

---

## Design decisions (summary)

1. **Direct API `Set-Cookie`**, not a Next BFF — simpler ops; works with same-site subdomain cookie Domain.
2. **Web 7d absolute / mobile 90d sliding** — product requirement; Instagram-style mobile idle.
3. **Access in memory + Bearer** — minimal client churn; 15m limits exposure.
4. **7d middleware marker** — Edge cannot see API cookies; must not track 15m access TTL.
5. **Cookie path `/api/v1/auth`** — refresh not attached to every API request.
6. **Single-flight refresh on the SPA** — required for correctness with rotating refresh tokens.
7. **Cutover: wipe legacy `localStorage` tokens** — force one re-login; no body→cookie migration bridge.
8. **Admin unchanged** — separate login, no Redis session cookie path.

## Operational checklist

### Deploy

1. Set `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN=.ezprep.in` and complete `CORS_ORIGINS` (apex + `www` if both serve students).
2. Deploy **API and web together**.
3. Existing web users **re-login once** (expected).

### Smoke after deploy

1. Login (OTP + Google) → `ezprep_rt` HttpOnly present; no auth tokens in `localStorage`.
2. Hard reload `/dashboard` → still authenticated (boot cookie refresh).
3. After ~15m → API call triggers one `POST /auth/refresh` 200; no login UI.
4. After 7d absolute → re-login.
5. Logout → cookie cleared; refresh fails; Redis session gone.
6. Mobile body refresh unchanged; admin login unchanged.
7. OTP widget + Razorpay under CSP.

### Known failure mode (fixed)

Parallel `POST /auth/refresh` (boot + axios 401, or Strict Mode double mount) caused refresh-token reuse detection to revoke the session and log users out on reload. Fix: module-level single-flight refresh + shared boot promise on the SPA.

## Future (Phase 12 mobile)

- Store refresh in SecureStore; shorten mobile access JWT (e.g. 1h).
- Keep Redis sliding 90d idle semantics unless product changes.
- Do not regress web HttpOnly cookie path.
